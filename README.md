Banking API project by Sergi Cort√©s

This is a banking API that is capable of storing three types of users:
- Admins that are able to create other users and accounts, among many other things that provide them with total control.
- Third Party users that can increase or decrease the balance in accounts when users perform purchases.
- Account holders, the customers of the bank, who will own accounts and will be able to transfer money, among other things.

There are several kinds of account with different properties and rules that provide account holders with different sorts of services.
